# ServiceRequestsCaseStudy
A simple WebApi project to make CRUD operations for a fictional service requests module.

Solution divided into 3 parts:
- WebAPI part = with the creation of CRUD operations in the API
- Unit Test part = with the unit tests (still need to be created)
- Web part = with Razor pages and the Controllers calling the APIs methods

Technologies used: 
- .NET Core 3.1 with C#
- xUnit framework to create unit tests
- IMemoryCache class, to mimic database behavior
- NewtonSoft.Json package to make JSON conversion from API to the model
- Bootstrap package, to make the layout not so ugly

Thanks, any suggestions of improvement is highly appreciated.
