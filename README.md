# ServiceRequestsCaseStudy
A simple WebApi project to make CRUD operations for a service requests module.

I created the API part but unfortunately, I struggled in the Web part, because since I have more experience with legacy projects (using Web Forms) than using Razor in .NET project,
I couldn't create a good front end solution to consume the API part.

Hopefully who that will analyze can understand that I'm just not used to use Razor syntax yet, but I certainly can learn and develop a better solution, given the time.

Anyway, here is my half project, thanks anyway.
